# arxiv-term
A simple Terminal Arxiv viewer

Just download the .py file and run
If you want to directly run from terminal you might want to give it execution access using 

```chmod +x arxiv.py```

For other help, Run the file with the ```-h```  flag

For Eg: If you are in the same folder as the file  ```./arxiv.py -h``` should give you all the necessary details.

Only few physics fields have been added now, More will be added later. As of now the app only shows the titles of the papers.
More features will be added soon.
